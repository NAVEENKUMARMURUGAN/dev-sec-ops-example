# DevSecOps Security Testing Examples 🛡️

This repository demonstrates different types of security testing in a DevSecOps pipeline.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── sast/                    # Static Application Security Testing
├── dast/                    # Dynamic Application Security Testing
├── sca/                     # Software Composition Analysis
├── container-security/      # Container Security Testing
└── .github/workflows/       # GitHub Actions workflows
```

Each directory contains:

1. A detailed README explaining the security testing type
2. Example configurations
3. Common tools and use cases
4. Sample commands to run the tests

The `.github/workflows` directory contains separate workflow files for each type of security testing, which can be triggered based on relevant file changes or scheduled runs.

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or add more specific examples?
